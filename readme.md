## Dataset

> The data had originally 113937 records and 81 columns with 871 duplicates, along with some Nan values in some columns.   


## Summary of Findings

> Through the preliminary exploratory analysis we some exciting findings, such as:

- The 871 duplicates were not completely duplicates, but the had the same unique listing key so for this reason they were removed.

- The prosper score had two out-of-range values (0,11), were one one hand we found that the 0 was given to records that dated before applying the prosper score system(2009). While on the other hand, the "11"s were outliers with no reoccurring pattern.

- In the Income range vs Prosper score figure, we can find that the average prosper score for the higher middle income range and not employed are nearly the same, which is a little bit odd due to the would-be difference in the financial status. 

- In 2014, there had no record of loans that lasted for 12 months
